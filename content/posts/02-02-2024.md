I have been trying my hand at creating pixel art from scratch (thanks to [Libresprite](https://libresprite.github.io/#!/)) and it's been oddly satisfying. I was able to whip up this familiar image fairly quickly using the original as a reference:

Something super interesting is how much you have to do with so little, so every pixel is really important and counts towards the final product. Also [dithering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither) can make such a difference for shading and gradients.

Anyway, this has been quite enjoyable and I hope to do more random little artworks in the future :D
